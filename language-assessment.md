A curated list of language interview questions.

**Note**: If you need to assess other language other than English, please translate the questions accordingly (the concept should be the same). :wink:

## <a name='guidelines'>Guidelines</a>

>Either you're looking for people that could read the technical documention or discuss the contract issues with a client, you'll need to evaluate how they could handle that in another language. The guidelines below provide some insight on how to proceed in a language assessment interview. Proper conversation and enthusiasm when a candidate talks provides a great indication of their language skills. 

* What
	* Ask questions that matters. If you only ask personal questions, don't expect they could discuss a complex subject with others.
	* See the last section a few sample questions
* Approach
	* Try to start with an ice breaker (easy questions). Expect the candidate to be nervous as probably the language is not their mother tongue.
	* Speak clearly and out aloud, especially if over the phone.
	* Be friendly!
* How long
	* Try to spend 5-10 minutes on this. Less than that is only applicable if the candidate cannot speak at all. More than that is too much.
