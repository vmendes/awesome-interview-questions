>Either you're looking for people that could read the technical documention or discuss the contract issues with a client, you'll need to evaluate how they could handle that in another language. 
The guidelines below provide some insight on how to proceed in a language assessment interview. 

Proper conversation and enthusiasm when a candidate discusses their previous projects and any projects they're working on in their spare time. If they get excited talking about these things, 
they show the kind of passion for software development that is a good indicator of whether they're capable of meeting the your bar.
Once you've calmed a nervous candidate's nerves or determined level of passion/enthusiasm, move on to the next set of questions. Try to spend a maximum of 5 minutes on this section.
